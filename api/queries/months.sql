-- name: ListMonthDots :many
-- One row per entry in the month, date-then-position order; the handler
-- groups rows into days. Only structure leaves the database — dots need
-- categories, never content (ADR-0004).
-- Visibility is the hidden-set (#30): a refined Entry follows its
-- Subcategory (shown even under a hidden parent), an unrefined one follows
-- its Category; empty arrays hide nothing.
