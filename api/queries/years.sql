-- name: ListYearFirstCategories :many
-- One row per recorded day: the FIRST Entry's category by entry order
-- (distinct on keeps the first row of each date's position ordering).
-- Only structure leaves the database — never content (ADR-0004).
-- Under the hidden-set (#30) the distinct-on picks the first VISIBLE entry,
-- so a day wears its topmost visible color; none visible, no row. A refined
-- Entry follows its Subcategory, an unrefined one its Category.
